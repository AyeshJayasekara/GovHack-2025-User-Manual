\newsection{SIEM alerts of vulnerability scans}

During the assessment, the DC security team alerted TCMS engineers of detected vulnerability scanning against their systems. The team was successfully able to identify the TCMS engineerâ€™s attacker IP address within minutes of scanning and was capable of blacklisting TCMS from further scanning actions.

\newchapter{Security weaknesses}

\newsection{Missing multi-factor authentication}

TCMS leveraged multiple attacks against DC login forms using valid credentials harvested through open-source intelligence. Successful logins included employee e-mail accounts through Outlook Web Access and internal access via Active Directory login on the VPN. The use of multi-factor authentication would have prevented full access and required TCMS to utilize additional attack methods to gain internal network access.

\newsection{Weak password policy}

TCMS successfully performed password guessing attacks against DC login forms, providing internal network access. A predictable password format of Summer2018! (season + year + special character) was attempted and successful.

\newsection{Unrestricted login attempts}

During the assessment, TCMS performed multiple brute-force attacks against login forms found on the external network. For all logins, unlimited attempts were allowed, which permitted a successful login on the Outlook Web Access application.

\newchapter{Vulnerabilities by impact}

The following chart illustrates the vulnerabilities found by impact: [INSERT TABLE HERE]

\newsection{Insufficient Lockout Policy -- Outlook Web App (Critical)}

\newsection{Exploitation proof of concept}

TCMS gathered historical breached data found in credentials dumps.  The data amounted to 868 total account credentials (Note: A full list of compromised accounts can be found in ``NTGAssist-867-19 Full Findings.xslx''.).
