Vector database contains the AI readable metadata in a form of multidimensional vector space.
Higher the dimensions, higher the accuracy of information retrieval.
However, in the local setup with extremely limited hardware resources the dimensions are kept to minimal
viable default provided by \emph{nomic-embed-text} of \textbf{768 dimensions}.

The information retrieval phase embedded to the information retrieval service \emph{(described in next chapter)} is set to
distance calculation method of \emph{cosine} accordingly.

To spin up a vector store:
\begin{lstlisting}
 docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
\end{lstlisting}

This will sping up a vector database to be used in next step.
