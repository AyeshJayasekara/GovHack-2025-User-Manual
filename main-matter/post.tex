The downloaded models and related artifacts maybe deleted from your system once you are satisfied with the demonstration.

The LLM model you downloaded may have consumed a lot of storage from your system.
Execute following to remove it:
\begin{lstlisting}
 ollama rm mistral
\end{lstlisting}

Similarly, the vector datastore may also be removed from your system. You can use \emph{Docker Desktop} if its installed in your system.
Or otherwise execute following:

\begin{lstlisting}
 docker ps -a
\end{lstlisting}

Above will list out any docker containers you ran previously. Note the container ID and execute following with subsituting container ID placeholder.

\begin{lstlisting}
 docker stop <ContainerID>
 docker rm <ContainerID>
 docker rmi qdrant/qdrant
\end{lstlisting}

Other components including the user interface and unified microservice can be deleted by removing the relevant folders where you have cloned them to.
